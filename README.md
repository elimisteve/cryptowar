Great quotes from the never-ending cryptowars - Additional historic quotes welcomed - please send quotes and links to [cryptowar@joncamfield.com](mailto:cryptowar@joncamfield.com)!

As we continuously debate "responsible encryption" here is a long scroll of pullquotes from the previous incarnations of CryptoWars. If you're concerned about this, <a href="https://supporters.eff.org/donate">donate to the EFF</a> -- they've always been there, fighting this insanity back.

*This builds off of my 2017 [blog post](https://joncamfield.com/blog/2017.10/we-have-always-been-war-crypto) capturing historic quotes and notes.*
