>"Opposing Clipper is an odd pairing of civil liberties activists and corporations. The activists worry that the government could have too much access to private exchanges. Companies have chafed at export restrictions that stop them from using the best encryption technologies in products they sell abroad. … Companies would rather include many different encryption technologies in the products they sell and don't want to be locked into government-approved hardware. They also point out that their **customers overseas are unlikely to want to use the Clipper lock knowing that the U.S. government holds the keys.**"

>"Perhaps you think your E-mail is legitimate enough that encryption is unwarranted. If you really are a law-abiding citizen **with nothing to hide, then why don't you always send your paper mail on postcards?**" … Keane would not comment directly on the Zimmermann case, but said, "Everybody who has looked at these issues would agree that, A, no court has decided these issues, and B, that these are very tough issues. Sooner or later some tough decisions are going to have to be made."
>One way the government has tried to address the widespread use of encryption is through stringent export regulations to control dissemination of such technologies. Those rules even apply to such garden-variety software as Norton Utilities, which offers encryption as part of its popular package of tools to help computer users manage their machines. The company sells two versions of the software: one for domestic use and an encryption-free version for international markets.
>**The government also has promoted the "Clipper Chip," a voluntary technology that would allow users to scramble their files and communications but still would be breakable by the government.** Widespread opposition to the Clinton administration's initial proposal last year sent the government back to the drawing board to find a more workable solution.

> "The problem is this: Individuals and businesses have **a legitimate need to protect information from interlopers** through the use of cryptography. But law enforcement officials fear that drug dealers and terrorists using cryptography will be able to thwart legally authorized surveillance and search warrants. National security officials are concerned that encrypted communications may frustrate intelligence collection against parties that might be building nuclear or biological weapons for use against the United States."

> "Although the Government has a strong interest in preserving national security, its Export Administration Regulations on encryption ("EAR") do not further this interest, and, in fact, may undermine it. The EAR are designed to prevent the foreign availability and use of "strong" (i.e., greater than 40-bit key length) encryption. Notwithstanding the existence of the EAR, however, strong encryption products already are used and widely available outside the United States. Thus, the EAR do little, if anything, to prevent foreign intelligence and law enforcement targets from obtaining and using strong encryption capabilities in their efforts to deny U.S. access to their communications. On this basis alone, the Government's attempt to justify the EAR as a direct and material means of preventing a threat to national security must fail."
>"Moreover, even if strong encryption were not already available to foreign entities, the Government's effort to prevent such availability through the use of the EAR is significantly undermined by the print exception to the EAR.(1) Nothing in the EAR prohibits a printed version of the encryption source code from export and, once abroad, conversion into electronic source code either manually or by automated means. As the District Court opinion (ER 544-78) described it, the print exception "undermines the stated purpose of the regulations." Id. at 568."

> "Similarly, the fight over encryption on the Internet will continue. **The government fears that allowing the unregulated use of message-scrambling technology would give criminals and terrorists a cloak to hide their digital activities**. So FBI Director Louis Freeh has **called for requirements that all encryption used in the United States have a back door so that law enforcement can unscramble the messages**, and is pushing for telecommunications networks to be designed with **built-in wiretapping capability**. In recent congressional testimony, Freeh termed those who oppose encryption controls as representatives of "narrow interests.""

> If the hunch of a loose-knit group of cyber-activists is correct, the above words will trip the keyword recognition filter on a global spy system partly managed by the US National Security Agency… Privacy activists have used the words in their signature files for years as a running schtick, but on 21 October, a group of activists orginating on the "hacktivist" mailing list hope to to trip up Echelon on a much wider scale.
> "What is [Echelon] good for?" asked Linda Thompson, a constitutional rights attorney and chairman of the American Justice Federation. "If you want to say we can catch criminals with it, **it is insane that anyone should be able to snoop on anyone's conversations…Criminals ought to be caught after they commit a crime -- but police are not here to invade all our privacy to catch that two percent [of criminal communications]**," she said.”

> "It took four months, a grim debate, and thousands of mailing list messages, but **the group that sets Internet standards has decided not to support wiretapping**…  "This is outrageous," wrote Ed Stone. "A third party taps a communication in secret, but the selection is NOT targeted to a SPECIFIC person, so it is not 'wiretapping.' This is simply incredible!"
